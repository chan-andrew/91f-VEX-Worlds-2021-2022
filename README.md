# 91F - VEX Worlds 2021–2022: Tipping Point

**Designed and Built by Andrew Chan**  
**Designed and Programmed by Hitaesh Saravanarajan**

This repository contains the full driver control and autonomous code for our robot used at both the **VEX States** and **VEX Worlds** competitions during the 2021–2022 **Tipping Point** season.

## Overview

Inside this repo, you’ll find:

- Modular driver control functions for motor movement and control
- Multiple autonomous routines tailored to competition strategy

## Key Highlights

- **Sub-0.6 Second Goal Rush**  
  Used extensively at States for lightning-fast neutral goal acquisition. This gave us a significant competitive edge during goal rush scenarios.

- **Kickstand-Assisted Worlds Routine**  
  Combined with the kickstand deployed during Worlds, this became one of the fastest goal rushes in our division.

- **Other Autonomous Routines Include**:
  - Center tall neutral goal rush
  - Full AWP (Autonomous Win Point) path
  - Left-side goal rush  
    *(All goal rushes secure the side’s ring in the mobile goal.)*
